## 🚀 Quick Start

### One-Command Build

```bash
./build_flawless.sh
```

This will:
1. ✓ Check all prerequisites
2. ✓ Validate project structure
3. ✓ Verify all features are present
4. ✓ Build the APK
5. ✓ Verify APK integrity
6. ✓ Show installation instructions

### Build Options

```bash
# Clean build (removes cache, takes longer but ensures fresh build)
./build_flawless.sh --clean

# Skip pre-build validation (faster, but not recommended)
./build_flawless.sh --no-tests

# Build and deploy to connected Android device
./build_flawless.sh --deploy

# Show all options
./build_flawless.sh --help
```

## 📋 Prerequisites

### System Requirements

- **Python 3.8+** (Python 3.9-3.11 recommended)
- **pip** (Python package manager)
- **git** (version control)
- **5GB+ free disk space** (for Android SDK/NDK)

### Linux (Ubuntu/Debian)

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y python3 python3-pip git build-essential \
    libssl-dev libffi-dev python3-dev \
    openjdk-17-jdk \
    autoconf automake libtool \
    libsdl2-dev libsdl2-image-dev libsdl2-mixer-dev libsdl2-ttf-dev
```

### Install Python Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 🔧 Build Scripts

### 1. Pre-Build Validation (`pre_build_check.py`)

Validates everything before building:

```bash
python3 pre_build_check.py
```

**Checks:**
- ✓ Python version compatibility
- ✓ Required packages installed
- ✓ Project structure complete
- ✓ All 26 exercises present
- ✓ All features implemented
- ✓ Assets exist (icon, splash screen)
- ✓ Buildozer.spec configured
- ✓ Android permissions set
- ✓ Disk space available

### 2. Main Build Script (`build_flawless.sh`)

Orchestrates the entire build process:

```bash
./build_flawless.sh
```

**Process:**
1. Check prerequisites
2. Clean environment (if --clean)
3. Run pre-build validation
4. Install dependencies
5. Build APK with buildozer
6. Verify APK integrity
7. Show results and instructions

### 3. Post-Build Verification (`post_build_verify.py`)

Verifies the APK after building:

```bash
python3 post_build_verify.py
```

**Checks:**
- ✓ APK found and valid
- ✓ Reasonable APK size
- ✓ Correct internal structure
- ✓ Python files packaged
- ✓ Assets included
- ✓ Native libraries present
- ✓ Manifest permissions correct

## 📱 Android Configuration

### Permissions

The app requests these permissions:

- `WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` - Save reports to Downloads
- `READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` - Read external storage
- `INTERNET` - Network access (optional)
- `MANAGE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` - Android 11+ full storage access

### Storage Handling

The app includes **smart storage handling** for all Android versions:

- **Android 5-9 (API 21-28)**: Direct Downloads folder access
- **Android 10 (API 29)**: Legacy storage with requestLegacyExternalStorage
- **Android 11+ (API 30+)**: Scoped storage with fallback to app-specific storage

### Runtime Permissions

The app automatically requests permissions on first launch. If permissions are denied, it falls back to app-specific storage.

## 🏗️ Build Configuration

### buildozer.spec Highlights

```ini
# Application
title = IGCSE GYM
package.name = igcsegym
package.domain = com.igcse

# Android
android.api = 33          # Target Android 13
android.minapi = 21       # Support Android 5.0+
android.archs = arm64-v8a # 64-bit ARM

# Requirements
requirements = python3,kivy==2.3.0,xlsxwriter

# Permissions
android.permissions = WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE,READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE,INTERNET,MANAGE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE

# Legacy storage for Android 10
android.manifest.application_attrs = android:requestLegacyExternalStorage="true"

# P4A develop branch for Python 3.11+ support
p4a.branch = develop
```

## 📊 Feature Verification

### How to Verify All Features Work

After building and installing the APK:

1. **Test Workout Sessions**
   - Open Session 1 - verify 8 exercises
   - Open Session 2 - verify 6 exercises
   - Log weight and reps for each

2. **Test Warmup Categories**
   - Open Warmup Menu
   - Test Dynamic Mobility (4 exercises)
   - Test Stability Training (4 exercises)
   - Test Movement Integration (4 exercises)

3. **Test Rest Timer**
   - Start rest timer from workout screen
   - Verify 75s default
   - Test quick select buttons
   - Test Start/Pause/Reset/Skip

4. **Test Report Export**
   - Go to View Reports
   - Click Download Report
   - Check Downloads folder
   - Verify Excel file opens with all data

5. **Test Data Persistence**
   - Log workouts
   - Close app
   - Reopen app
   - Verify data persists

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Build Fails

**Problem**: Buildozer fails with SDK/NDK errors

**Solution**:
```bash
# Clean build from scratch
./build_flawless.sh --clean
```

**Problem**: Out of disk space

**Solution**:
```bash
# Check available space
df -h

# Clean up buildozer cache
rm -rf ~/.buildozer
```

### APK Issues

**Problem**: APK won't install on device

**Solution**:
1. Enable "Install from Unknown Sources"
2. Check device has Android 5.0+
3. Verify APK is not corrupted:
   ```bash
   python3 post_build_verify.py
   ```

**Problem**: Storage permissions denied

**Solution**:
- App will request permissions on launch
- If denied, will fallback to app-specific storage
- Reports will be saved to app folder instead of Downloads

### Feature Issues

**Problem**: Excel export not working

**Solution**:
- App includes xlsxwriter (pure Python)
- If Excel fails, CSV fallback is automatic
- Check storage permissions granted

**Problem**: Exercises not showing

**Solution**:
- Run pre-build check: `python3 pre_build_check.py`
- Verify all 26 exercises in validation output
- Rebuild if needed
